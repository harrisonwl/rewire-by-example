## Haskell

Here are some good sources:
- **Programming in Haskell** by Graham Hutton.
This is an excellent, step-by-step introduction to Haskell. Graham also has a lot of online resources (slides, videos, etc.) to go along with the book.
- **Learn You a Haskell for Good** by Miran Lipovaca.
Highly amusing and informative; available [here](https://learnyouahaskell.com/).
- **A Gentle Introduction to Haskell** by Hudak, Peterson, and Fasal. 
Available at [http://www.haskell.org/tutorial/](http://www.haskell.org/tutorial/).
- **Real World Haskell** by Bryan O'Sullivan.
Also available online (I believe). 
-  Google.
- **Haskell for Grownups**. These are some slides ([HaskellForGrownups.pdf](HaskellForGrownups.pdf)) I've presented here and there over the years as a quick intro to Haskell and what all the fuss is about.
